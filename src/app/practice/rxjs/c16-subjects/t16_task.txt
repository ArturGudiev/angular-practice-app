1) make sure each subscriber gets a new observable
2) make sure each subscriber of subject receives the same notification of sub
3) make sure behaviour subject buffers last emitter value
  solves the problem of a late subscriber

4) set initial value without touching numbers inside
5) print sum of elements with initial 10
6) t6_combine_sources_into_one

7) create task with replay subject
  send last 2 values for late subscriber

8) create task with async subject
  send 1, 2, 3
    but all subscribers should print only 3
